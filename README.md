I choosed this subject because Python is very popular back end language and I've seen it in a lot of job descriptions. Plus it is similar to Ruby and I have Ruby knowledge so that I thought it would be better to learn Python.

What are the alternatives? Ruby
What is it similar to, if anything? Ruby

What is the history of this technology?
Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system Amoeba.

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
I liked Python because it seems very similar to Ruby and has really clear syntax. Soon I want to improve myself using Django with Pyton and create cool apps.

What resources do you recommend for interested students?
YouTube videos and online code courses like CodeSchool and CodeAcademy.
